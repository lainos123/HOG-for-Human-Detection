    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we utilise the INDRA Person Images dataset to validate person object annotations. For each annotated person (represented by a bounding box), we examine the adjacent regions directly to the left and right of the box. If these neighbouring regions do not contain any annotated persons, we extract them and resize to 64x128 pixels to create candidate ‘negative’ samples—images that are presumed to contain no people.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because the original dataset annotations are not perfectly accurate, some of these regions may still include people. To address this, we manually review and select negative samples to ensure they do not contain any visible persons.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Left Right Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "We intentionally restrict our negative sampling to areas horizontally adjacent (left and right) to detected persons. This is based on the assumption that people appear on the ground plane. By using existing person annotations as a reference for the horizontal level and scale where people are likely to appear, we can more reliably sample background regions that are at a similar height and perspective, improving the consistency of our negative examples."
